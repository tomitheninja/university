# My notes for introduction to programming I.

## Exam rules

You can browse https://en.cppreference.com/w/ during the exam. I highly recommend using https://devdocs.io/cpp instead, as it is generated from cppreference.com, but has a better search engine and style.

You should not use this repository, but you can use code from your previous homeworks.

You can use the full c++11 language, including all built in types and functions. I am planning to create a tutorial for them soon.

## Help wanted

I wrote more than half of this repository while being half asleep.

That means there are probably multiple issues with it.

Fill free report them via [github issues](https://github.com/tomitheninja/university/issues) or on [discord](http://discordapp.com/users/335860149749153802).

Contributions in code and feature requests are welcomed.
